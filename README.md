Hello everyone 😀,

I wanted to share a recent task I completed where I implemented a linear regression model to predict house prices. The goal was to use features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms to predict the price of a house.

I began by collecting and preprocessing the data, making sure it was clean and ready for analysis. Using Python and the scikit-learn library, I trained a linear regression model.

To evaluate the model, I used Mean Squared Error and the R-squared score, which provided insights into the model's performance. One of the challenges I faced was handling missing values and ensuring data quality. This project underscored the importance of these steps in building an effective model.

In the end, the model performed well, achieving a good R-squared score, indicating it was a good fit for the data. This experience has been incredibly valuable, and I'm excited to continue applying these skills.
